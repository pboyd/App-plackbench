0.2  2014-07-11
      - switch shebang to /usr/bin/perl (/bin/env is not that common apparently,
        maybe /usr/bin/env would have been better, but I'm hoping /usr/bin/perl
        is really standard.)
      - Use the older API for Getopt::Long (should work in 2.38 at least,
        probably older versions as well.)
      - Removed test that assumed "No such file" will be in English
